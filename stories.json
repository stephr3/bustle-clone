  "text": "1. Gently tilt your head back to a comfortable position and allow your mouth to hang open widely while you gently extend into it; 2. Contract the back of the throat as if to perform Ujjayi breathing — a whispery breath — which is typically done through your nose with your mouth closed. Breathe deeply through your mouth so you feel the air hit the back of your throat; 3. Inhale and exhale completely while allowing your shoulders to relax as you exhale; 4. When the yawn comes, reach and extend into it, riding the yawn to stretch the jaw muscles; 5. Repeat 8-10 times until tearing starts. As your jaw muscles stretch and relax, and the yawn expands, the lachrymal glands around the eye are squeezed and tearing is induced."

  "text": "Two Nassau County parents are outraged about two books their middle schoolers brought home from the school library.The covers look harmless enough but when parents saw the profanity and sexually explicit language inside, they called Action News Jax. From paragraphs about sex, to drinking alcohol and stripping, Yulee Middle School parents said they are furious that these books are on the shelves of the school library. \"I have in no way shape or form authorized my children to read such material, I can tell you that,\" said parent, Brook Todd.Todd has five kids in the Nassau County school district and one at the middle school. She said the books made her uncomfortable.\"I was reading a lot of sexual content and some things that I wouldn't think high schoolers should have access to,\" Todd said.The two books are titled “TTFN,” meaning ta ta for now, and “TTYL,” short for talk to you later and look harmless."
